# dotfiles
An initial setup of dotfiles I use. This is very rudimentary and won't be near complete for a while.

## Neovim
### SUSE
```
sudo zypper in neovim
sudo zypper in python-neovim python3-neovim
```
### Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install neovim
sudo apt install python3-neovim
```

```
cd ~; wget
```
